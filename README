Announcment:

We have a comprehensive version of trigger.
But it cannot apply to the newest version of sample data.
Because in the newest version of sample data, exists team member have same leg in the same heat!!

If you want to use the comprehensive version:

Here goes the code:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION Swimtrig()
RETURNS TRIGGER
AS $trigger1$
    BEGIN
    IF NEW.leg <1 OR NEW.leg>4 THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'leg cannot be negative or larger than 4';
    ELSIF NEW.leg IN
    (SELECT Swim.leg as leg FROM Swim
    INNER JOIN Participant ON Participant.id = Swim.Participant_id
    INNER JOIN Org ON Org.id = Participant.org_id
    WHERE Org.id = (SELECT Org.id AS uid FROM Participant
    INNER JOIN Org ON Org.id = Participant.org_id
    WHERE Participant.id = NEW.Participant_id)
    AND Swim.meet_name = NEW.meet_name
    AND Swim.event_id = NEW.event_id
    AND Swim.heat_id = NEW.heat_id)
    THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'swimmer cannot take the same leg with his/her teammates';
    ELSIF (SELECT gender FROM Participant
    WHERE Participant.id = NEW.Participant_id)
    NOT IN
    (SELECT gender FROM Event
    WHERE Event.id = NEW.event_id)
    THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'the gender of the swimmer is not correct for this event';
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
    END $trigger1$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS swim_trig ON Swim;
CREATE TRIGGER swim_trig BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON Swim FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE Swimtrig();
